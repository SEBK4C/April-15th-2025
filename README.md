# Talk: Determinism, Randomness, and Reality: What AI Can (and Can't) Really Do

This repository hosts the presentation slides for Sebastian Graf's talk at the AI Future Council.

The talk explores:
*   The actual mechanics of Large Language Models (context windows, determinism, randomness).
*   How AI interacts with and potentially breaks existing bureaucratic systems.
*   Near-future predictions for GenAI, web infrastructure, and AI protocols.
*   The importance of understanding AI systems beyond hype and fear.
